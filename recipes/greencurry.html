        Green curry is a classic Thai dish that is known for its balance of heat and sweetness. The base of the curry is made with green curry paste, which is a mixture of ingredients such as green chilies, lemongrass, galangal, kaffir lime leaves, and other spices. This paste is simmered with coconut milk, meat (chicken, beef, or tofu), vegetables, and Thai basil, to create a zesty and flavorful sauce.
