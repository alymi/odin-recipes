        Thai red curry is a popular dish originating from Thailand, known for its bold and spicy flavor. It is made by simmering red curry paste, coconut milk, and various ingredients such as meat (chicken, beef, or tofu), vegetables, and Thai basil, in a sauce. The red curry paste, which is the base of the dish, is made from a blend of chili peppers, shallots, garlic, lemongrass, and other spices, giving the curry its distinct heat and complexity.
