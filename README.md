# odin-recipes
Third Odin practice repo, testing HTML knowledge so far

This is a sort of section-final-project that will produce a recipe website that demonstrates understanding of HTML concepts covered so far: 
    Boilerplate / VSC shortcut to create the boilerplate
    Text formatting (Headings, font color and size, paragraphs, etc)
    Links and images (local) with a tidy file structure
